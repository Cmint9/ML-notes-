# Machine Learning and algorithm application
In our daily life, we come across a lot of algorithms for Machine learning. In the process of learning, I have explored algorithms such as KNN, K-means, SVM, etc., and integrated them into different projects. For example, Race with bayes, Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Kaggle, these projects not only help us to understand more about machine learning algorithms, but also help us to learn how to deal with huge databases and how to extract the information we want.


# Know about the classification of Machine learning:
AI combines sensory Intelligence (image recognition, speech recognition, Gesture recognition 图像识别、语言识别和手势识别) and recognition Intelligence( 语言理解知识和推理 language comprehension knowledge and reasoning).
# Here are some AI branches
#### Traditional machine learning
*  Data Mining
* CV- Computer Vision 
* NLP(Natural language processing)
* Speech Recognition
* Decision Making 

#### Deep learning
### Reinforcement learning (强化学习）

Academic Term:
Machine learning is the study of algorithms that generate models from data.
* Data Set: 数据集
* Sample or Instance: one record 
* Feature/ Attribute 特征向量
* Feature vector 特征向量
* Dimensionality 维数
* Training data 训练数据
* Training set 训练集
* Training Sample
* Hypothesis 假设
* Groud_truth 真相
* label 标记
* Classification 分类 
* Regression 回归
* Positive class 正类
* Negative class 反类

  ## Project1: K-nearest- neighbor
  ## project2: K-Means
  ## Project4: Race with Bayes
  ## Project6: Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Kaggle
  In project 6, the professor provided many different databases from which to choose. Therefore, in project 6, we can process the relevant data according to the machine learning        
  algorithm that we have learned before. With the development of AI, the diagnosis and treatment of modern diseases are closer to AI. Therefore, I chose the database from Kaggle and 
  used machine learning to process and diagnose the breast cancer data.
