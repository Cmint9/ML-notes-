# Know about what is the classification of Machine learning:
AI combines sensory Intelligence (image recognition, speech recognition, Gesture recognition 图像识别、语言识别和手势识别) and recognition Intelligence( 语言理解知识和推理 language comprehension knowledge and reasoning).
# Here are some AI intelligence branches
#### Traditional machining learning
---  Data Mining
---- CV- Computer Vision 
---- NLP(Natural language processing)
---- Speech Recognition
---- Decision Making 

#### Deep learning
### Reinforcement learning (强化学习）
