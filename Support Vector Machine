How we understand Support Vectore Machine(SVM)?

When should we learn SVM?
--- From linear regression model, we can got the SVM mode, but how we choose them?
1. the rule: m is training data,
    n >> m , training data is not enough to support training a complicate un-linear model , so we can choose logic regression model.
